## Convertible Tops

We feature convertible tops in a wide variety of materials to suit your budget as well as more exotic solution dyed acrylic cloth tops for sports cars and imports. Our specialty is in troubleshooting hydraulic, electrical and mechanical problems as well as offer one day service on most convertibles.

## Headliners

By far, one of the major problems common to virtually all late-model cars is the sagging headliner. Because the original headliner material is foam backed, over a period of time the foam backing starts to disintegrate and leaves a dust residue causing the fabric to drop loose from the headliner board. Correcting the sagging headliner involves a multi step process that will restore it to like "new" condition. In fact, we guarantee our headliners for five years.

We install only the finest leather kits that are custom made for your vehicle.

## Automotive Carpet

Carpets are generally custom ordered to fit your particular car. We offer a choice of poly or mass backed carpets. These carpets are 100% Nylon and come with new padding and a vinyl heal pad. The difference between the poly and mass backed carpets is in the type and thickness of the backing. The thicker mass backed carpet increases the heat and sound insulation properties of the car. The average installation time for carpets is four to six hours and requires a small deposit. We also offer fitted vinyl floor mats for commercial trucks and vans.
