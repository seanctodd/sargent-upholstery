## Convertible Tops

Whether you're replacing a worn-out top or upgrading to a premium material, we install convertible tops for all makes and models — from classic Mustangs to late-model Miatas. We offer vinyl, canvas, and solution-dyed acrylic cloth options to fit every budget and style.

Beyond installation, we troubleshoot and repair hydraulic, electrical, and mechanical convertible top systems. Most top replacements are completed in a single day.

We source our tops from the industry's best manufacturers:

- [**GAHH Automotive**](https://www.gahh.com) — the largest convertible top manufacturer in the U.S., offering OEM-quality tops for a wide range of vehicles
- [**Robbins Auto Tops**](https://www.robbinsautotop.com) — premium aftermarket tops known for precise fit and factory-grade materials
- [**EZ-ON Auto Tops**](https://www.ezonautotops.com) — American-made tops with easy installation and excellent durability

## Headliners

By far, one of the major problems common to virtually all late-model cars is the sagging headliner. Because the original headliner material is foam backed, over a period of time the foam backing starts to disintegrate and leaves a dust residue causing the fabric to drop loose from the headliner board. Correcting the sagging headliner involves a multi step process that will restore it to like "new" condition. In fact, we guarantee our headliners for five years.

## OEM Seat Cover Replacement & OEM-Match Parts
We specialize in OEM seat cover replacement and high-quality aftermarket OEM-match seat covers that restore your interior to factory condition. We’ll help you find the best match for your vehicle at a price point that fits your budget. This option typically requires the least amount of downtime, getting you back on the road quickly.

## Custom Seat Covers

Our seat covers are made of the finest quality materials and produced by master craftsmen according to our customer's specifications. We specialize in the unusual and hard to fit. Everything from tractor seats to after market racing seats. Please call for pricing information.

## Leather Kits

Upgrading your interior to leather will increase the value of your car and improve the overall comfort and driving experience. The smell of leather is equal to none. We install only the finest leather kits that are custom made for your vehicle. They can be fully customizable with options such as different color seat inserts, thread color, perforated leather, and much more!

## Automotive Carpet

Carpets are generally custom ordered to fit your particular car. We offer a choice of poly or mass backed carpets. These carpets are 100% Nylon and come with new padding and a vinyl heal pad. The difference between the poly and mass backed carpets is in the type and thickness of the backing. The thicker mass backed carpet increases the heat and sound insulation properties of the car. The average installation time for carpets is four to six hours and requires a small deposit. We also offer fitted vinyl floor mats for commercial trucks and vans.
