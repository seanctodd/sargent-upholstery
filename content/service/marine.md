## Built to Handle Life on the Water

Jacksonville's sun, salt, and humidity are brutal on boat interiors. We use marine-grade vinyl, UV-resistant thread, and closed-cell foam that won't absorb water — so your upholstery holds up season after season.

## Boat Seat Upholstery

From center consoles to cabin cruisers, we reupholster boat seats with materials built for the marine environment. Whether it's a single captain's chair or a full interior overhaul, we deliver factory-quality results that last.

## Why Boat Owners Choose Us

We've been doing marine work in Jacksonville since 1935. We know the materials that survive Florida weather and the construction methods that keep seams tight and zippers running smooth. Bring your boat by for a free estimate.
