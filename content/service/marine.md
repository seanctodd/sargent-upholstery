## Boat Seat Upholstery

From center consoles to cabin cruisers, we reupholster boat seats using marine-grade vinyl and fabrics built to withstand sun, salt, and moisture. Whether you need a single captain's chair recovered or a full interior overhaul, our craftsmen deliver factory-quality results.

## Custom Canvas & Covers

We fabricate custom canvas boat covers, bimini tops, T-top enclosures, and cockpit covers using Sunbrella and other premium marine fabrics. Every cover is patterned and sewn to fit your vessel precisely, providing lasting protection from the elements.

## Interior Restoration

Restore your boat's interior to like-new condition. We replace worn headliners, re-cover cabin cushions, and repair or replace interior panels. Our marine-rated materials resist mildew, UV damage, and water intrusion.

## Exterior Cushions & Bolsters

Custom-made cockpit cushions, bolster pads, and deck seating built for comfort and durability. We use closed-cell foam and quick-dry materials so your cushions perform in any conditions.
