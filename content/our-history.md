## A Family Tradition
Locally owned for over 80 years in Jacksonville, Florida, Sargent Upholstery was originally known as Sargent Seat Cover Company and founded by Henry Sargent in 1935. Margaret and Marion Todd purchased the company in 1954, and it has remained a family owned company ever since. Marion, a World War II veteran that served in the Coast Guard, attended business school at night after the war while working a full time job during the day to support his family. He was determined to run his own successful business, and purchasing Sargent Seat Cover Company gave him that opportunity with an established business that had prospects for growth.

At the time of purchase, the company was located on Main Street in Springfield and there were three full time employees. Under the leadership of the Todds, Sargent Seat Cover Company was rebranded as Sargent Upholstery Co. and quickly outgrew the space on Main Street. The Todds purchased their current property downtown at 44 East 1st Street in 1962. Originally a grocery store, the property was remodeled and an east wing was added. Several other adjoining properties were purchased since, and additional buildings were constructed as the business continued to grow.

Margaret and Marion's son, Mike Todd, grew up in the family business and took over for his parents when they retired. He is a graduate of the University of Central Florida and served in the Army Reserves. Mike is now the president of Sargent Upholstery. Sean Todd, the third generation to work in the family business, is now the vice president of Sargent Upholstery.

Sargent Upholstery started out providing car upholstery, installing plastic covers for bucket and bench seats in cars. Today, they've expanded to installing any kind of custom car upholstery and repair, convertible tops, car headliners, and contract upholstery for hospitality and medical facilities. The Todd family takes great pride in their work and serving the Jacksonville community.
