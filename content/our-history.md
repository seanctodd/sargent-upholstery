## Quality & Service Since 1935

Sargent Upholstery Co. has been a cornerstone of Jacksonville's automotive services community since 1935. For nearly nine decades, the Todd family has carried on a tradition of expert craftsmanship, attention to detail, and genuine care for every customer who walks through our doors.

## A Family Tradition

What started as a small upholstery shop on the east side of Jacksonville has grown into one of the region's most trusted names in automotive interior work. Through three generations, the Todd family has maintained the same commitment to quality that our founders established — treating every vehicle with the respect and precision it deserves.

## Honoring America One Stitch at a Time

Our tagline is more than just words — it reflects our deep pride in American craftsmanship and our belief that quality work is a form of patriotism. Every stitch, every cut, and every installation is done with the same care and integrity that has defined Sargent Upholstery for generations.

## Our Home

Located at 44 E 1st St in Jacksonville, FL, our shop has been a fixture of the local community for decades. We invite you to visit us, see our work firsthand, and experience the Sargent difference.
